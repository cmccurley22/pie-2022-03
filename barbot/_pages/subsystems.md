# Divide and Conquer
Barbot takes advantage of three very important systems: Mechanical; Electrical; Firmware. In developing the BarBot, we had to make sure that the electrical and firmware architecture was ready to recieve the motor assemblies that would carry our drink dispensing pumps.

Mechanical: In charge of pump assembly development.

Electrical: In charge of creating and optimizing circuitry.

Firmware: In charge or creating and optimizing the dispensing and user interface.

_TODO: Add images to go next to, if not ontop, the subsystem abstracts_

_TODO: Add embedded links to redirect to the respective subsystems_
